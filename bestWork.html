        <h2>My Best Work</h2>
        <p>Being in <i>INSPIRE</i> has allowed me to work on a lot of projects, on this page you'll see some of my best projects.</p>

        <h2>The Beast</h2>
        <img src="images/Server.JPG" alt="The 6 Display computer">
        <p>What is the <i>Beast</i>? The <i>Beast</i> is an hp z820 server that its main puprose is data processing. But I have converted it into a 6 display computer</p>
        <p>Why build this? Well the short answer is why not. The long asnwer is we wanted a computer to be able to show information about our shcool better than the tv in the hallway.
        We wanted to achieve this by running 7 displays. Well even though therer are only 6 displays it is capable of running 7. The computer will sit out in the hallway in a custom made shelf
      with all 6 displays outside with the 7th in the room to be the master controller. </p>
      <p>Does it work? yes it works but how well is the question. The computer's processor is a xeon which is great for data transfer but not running multiple things. The Xeon is a cpu with more than 1 core
        but they do not work together, that's why it is so good at running data. Each core has its own thing it handles, while a more traditional i7 will work together to run the task. The pc still runs
        well but gets chopped up sometimes. To remedy this we have ordered a second cpu to help take some of the load off.</p>
      <p>This computer took a long time to get running, about a 3-4 month project. The problem was getting windows to boot to a raid configured hardrive. So I put a seperate ssd with in the computer for windows to boot to.
      this way we can use the 2tb raid system as a second hardrive instead of the main load.</p>

      <h2>Dell Poweredge T610</h2>

      <p>The Poweredge is a dell server that is getting ran for online mass storage. There's nothing else to really say about it.
